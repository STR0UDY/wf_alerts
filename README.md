# wf_alerts
 No requirements are needed to run this script, but for the icons to work you must use your own fontawesome url link.
 To do that, open up /html/alerts.html and then go onto Line: 7, once you're on line 7, head towards https://fontawesome.com/
 And basically sign up for free, grab the javascript link they provide you and replace it with "url_here".
 
 **NOTES** 
 This is intended as a development release only, at any time I choose to, I can fully stop the support of this script and leave it to your own devices, updates to this script will only come when as I please and when I please, if you have any bugs make an Issues or contact me on my Discord **Stroudy#0666**.
 
 The release is "as-is" meaning the intent of this release is for you to take my basic concept and do as you wish to your own willing.
 This script is in no way affiliated with NoPixel, just the styling itself is purely based off of Koils Script.
 That being said, I don't claim for this script to be fully 100% functional nor working, they may be bugs, they may not be.

**PLEASE READ**
As of V2 Push, (15/06/2020 22:49 BST) The database is a must, you just simply drag and drop like you do regularly.
Upon looking in the file of "cl_main.lua" you will notice a much cleaner approach, this is to tackle any confusion.
It is VERY easy to add your own codes, follow the example I have provided and you will do just fine.
If you go into the database and set "is_important" to 1, this will cause the alert to flash blue/red.
Follow the array format for the recepients, you can add or remove with this method.
Mostly, have fun.
